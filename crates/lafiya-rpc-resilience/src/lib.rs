//! Reference prototype for RPC provider failover, retry classification, and
//! transaction-recovery polling produced for the RPC failover spike (see
//! `docs/adr/0011-rpc-provider-failover-and-transaction-recovery.md`).
//!
//! # Problem this models
//!
//! The CLI and Bash scripts submit a signed transaction to a single
//! configured RPC endpoint and treat "the HTTP call failed" as "the
//! transaction did not happen." That assumption is false for a timeout,
//! connection reset, or 5xx: the request may have reached the network
//! before the response was lost. Blindly resubmitting a *new* transaction
//! in that state risks a duplicate on-chain effect (e.g. adding the same
//! attester twice, or -- for a differently-shaped future operation -- a
//! double-spend). Blindly giving up risks losing an operation that actually
//! succeeded.
//!
//! This crate is not a Soroban RPC client. It is a small, dependency-free
//! state machine that a real client can wrap: it classifies a submit
//! failure as safe-to-retry or must-poll-first, and it implements the
//! poll-before-retry recovery loop across an ordered list of providers.
//! [`mock`] provides a scriptable fake provider so the exact failure
//! sequences described in the ADR (timeout-before-send, ambiguous
//! timeout-after-send, rate limiting, and a hard-down primary) can be
//! reproduced deterministically in `tests/failure_injection.rs` and
//! `examples/failure_injection_demo.rs` without a network or a live RPC
//! endpoint.
